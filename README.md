# Gutenberg-Blocks-for-Beginners
The starter files for the Gutenberg Blocks for Beginners Course.

We've included the source code for the 3 plugins we build together in the Gutenberg Blocks for Beginners course:
1. The block-examples plugin
2. The block-examples-scalable plugin
3. The block-examples-scalable-production plugin

To use the source code you'll need to have a WordPress website you can add the plugins too.  If you took the Gutenberg Blocks for Beginners course you should have a WordPress website on your computer as we walk through setting up a WordPress site on your computer.  If you haven't gotten that far you can still install these plugins on your existing website.

To quickly get started using these files:
1. Download the zip file of the source code
2. Upload the plugins to your WordPress website
3. Activate the plugins you want to use

If you want to modify the code and do any sort of development you'll do the same thing as above but you'll also need to:
1. Use the command line to install all tooling dependencies as we do in the course by running npm install in the directory of the plugin you want to modify
